# BiMap

A map variant that maps keys to values and, in contrast to regular maps, also
vice versa. Mostly this is an abstraction over two individual maps with all
the bookkeeping taken care of. The API should be fairly self-explanatory - it
is essentially equal to that of a regular map, just with every operation
duplicated to support both key- and value-oriented approaches. Use this
module by importing from `@sirpepe/shed/BiMap`.
